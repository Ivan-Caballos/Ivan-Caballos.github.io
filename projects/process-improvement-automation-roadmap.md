# Manufacturing Process Improvement — Test & Programming Automation (Case Study)

**Context:** Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) environment with repeated programming/test steps and multiple product variants.

I created a practical, phased roadmap to reduce setup friction, improve repeatability, and enable data-driven decisions through traceability and automation. This case study summarizes the approach without disclosing company-specific details.

## Problem Pattern Observed

- Repeated station setup and frequent task switching increased errors and slowed throughput.
- Heavy reliance on a small number of “key people” for troubleshooting and decisions.
- Paper-based or fragmented logging made it hard to quantify issues and improvements.
- Variant handling (different SKUs / firmware / options) increased the chance of wrong settings.

---

## Proposed Approach (Phased)

### Phase 1 — Stabilize & Measure (Baseline)
- Standardize station setup and working method (simple checklists + visual aids).
- Introduce lightweight digital logging (QR-based traceability) to create a baseline dataset.
- Define “golden sample” references and a clear fault-escalation path.

### Phase 2 — Automate the Highest-Repeat Steps
- Profile-driven execution for programming steps (variant profiles, validation checks).
- Reduce manual selection steps and enforce correct configuration via scanned IDs.
- Improve repeatability with fixtures and consistent connections where applicable.

### Phase 3 — Expand Automation + Improve Flow Visibility
- Extend automation concepts to additional test stations where it’s measurable and stable.
- Improve cross-department visibility of WIP, blockers, and priorities (simple dashboards/logs).
- Iterate based on real failure modes and measured bottlenecks.

## Expected Benefits (Qualitative)

- Fewer wrong-setting / wrong-variant errors.
- Reduced setup time and less context switching.
- More resilient operation (less dependency on individuals).
- Traceable historical data to quantify improvements and guide next steps.

> Note: Quantitative time savings require baseline data collection; the first phase explicitly enables that measurement.

## My Role / What I Delivered

- Mapped the workflow at a station level and identified repeatable friction points.
- Proposed a realistic phased plan emphasizing measurement first, then automation.
- Defined practical deliverables per phase (standard work, traceability, profiles, fixtures).

---

## Next Steps

- Pilot QR logging on one station and collect baseline data for 2–4 weeks.
- Implement one “profile-driven” automated step and compare error rate + cycle time.
- Scale to additional stations only after the pilot is stable and repeatable.
